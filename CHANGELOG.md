## Version 2.8.0 [2024-03-18]

* **BREAKING CHANGES**
This release tries to resolve long term problems with apt repositories and legacy GPG keys. For a long time ansible module `apt_repository` was used to manage repositories and a separate module `apt_key` to manage keys.
This approach was not perfect and caused problems with newer Linux Mint releases. This release introduces new approach to add repositories and keys. It uses `deb822` ansible module to add both: repositories and keys. However, this change is breaking and requires manual intervention. Please, read the documentation and follow the instructions to update your system.
You can expect removal of old repositories from `/etc/apt/sources.list.d\*.list` and replace them with *.sources in deb822 format. As this playbook's role is not to manage outside repositories, you still can have apt refresh failing with a warning - you have to clean these manually (or add them as your own repositories in `deb822` format)

For `custom_repositories` variable now it accepts only deb822 format as in the example below

```yaml
  - name: google-cloud-sdk
    types: deb
    suites: cloud-sdk
    components: main
    uris:
      - "https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt"
    enabled: true
    architectures: amd64
    signed_by: https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg
```

* **BREAKING_CHANGES**
With all possible packages available in FLATPAK, this release will try to remove all packages from `packages_optional` and `packages` and moves them to `flatpak`. This change is breaking and requires manual intervention. Please, read the documentation and follow the instructions to update your system.
You can expect in some cases, config for your application is missing (for example Remmina package). Do not panic, these files are already there, mostly in `~.config` or `~.local/share` directories. You can copy them manually to the new location (`~/.var/app/...`)
In future releases, I'll try to move all packages to FLATPAK and remove them `per repository` from the playbook.
This move also forces to remove classic 'repositories` which are no longer required.
Also, in future releases I'll separate FLATPAK packages to `mandatory` and `optional` to make it easier to manage.
